Whether the joy and cries of nature, mirrored in mankind. Hello everyone, we are Team RainRainGoAway. Our team is led by Rafin Islam Niloy, our dedicated team leader. Joining him are Muhammad Nahid, our UI/UX and app developer, and Nazmul Hasan Labid, who is our researcher and scriptwriter.

Growing up in a tropical area, our deep connection with the weather led us to the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025. We have embraced the "Will it rain on my parade?" challenge, weaving our passion and expertise into the mission concept category. With a shared passion and collective expertise, our team took on the mysteries of weather in a unique and innovative way. Planning an event, a hike, or a fishing trip means facing the unpredictable. From sudden downpours to unexpected storms, we've all been caught off guard.

Climate change is reshaping weather patterns, making adverse events more frequent and less predictable. This is where we come in. We are Team Rain Rain Go Away, and we have a solution. We've tapped into NASA's powerful Earth observation data to build a weather application that provides you with a clear, reliable forecast for your outdoor activities.

Our app is powered by the very same satellites that monitor our world from the depths of space, giving you a wealth of information to make informed decisions. We're not just telling you the temperature, we're showing you the chances of adverse weather for any time and location you choose. Now, let's dive into our project. This is Weather Wizard, an innovative web app that taps into NASA's powerful satellite data to deliver real-time weather forecasting.

To get started, simply select a location and a date of your choice. Let's choose Silhet, Bangladesh. I want to plan a trip to Sri Mangal on September 5. Next, we can set our preferred weather conditions. Let's go with very hot and set a threshold of 30 degrees Celsius. By clicking weather likelihood, the app instantly shows the probability of adverse weather for that day, saving you from unexpected surprises.

For a deeper dive, the Weather Insights section provides a detailed analysis, including the specific NASA missions powering these forecasts. Each mission link is interactive, letting you explore their groundbreaking research and the data behind it. With Weather Wizard, planning trips or activities become smarter, more reliable, and directly connected to the science of space. Why does this matter? Because the world is changing. The weather we grew up with is no longer the weather we live with.

Adverse events, the floods, the heat waves, the sudden storms are becoming more frequent, more intense and more unpredictable. For years we've relied on simple percentages and vague forecasts. We've been forced to accept ambiguity, leading to cancelled plans and frustrating surprises. But in a world where a sudden storm can be a matter of safety, partly cloudy is no longer enough.

We need more. We need real-time accurate data. In conclusion, weather is power, and it's our duty to understand and harness it. Join us at Weather Wizard, where knowledge turns into action. Dive into understanding and unlock the power to predict change. Help us create waves of change by inviting others to become weather guardians against climate unpredictability. Let's make this technology even more powerful by connecting it to a network of real-time data from every corner of the globe.

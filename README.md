A Next-Generation Tool for Customizing Your Comfort Threshold and Forecasting Adverse Conditions<br>
<h1>Introduction</h1><br>

<p>Welcome to WeatherWizard, a highly personalized web application designed to go beyond traditional weather reports. Instead of just reporting raw temperature or rainfall, WeatherWizard allows users to define their own comfort levels and get precise likelihood predictions for adverse weather conditions at any chosen location and time.

By integrating cutting-edge forecasting data with AI-powered insights, WeatherWizard helps users plan outdoor activities, travel, and day-to-day routines with confidence.</p>

<h2>Core Features and Personalization</h2>
<br>
WeatherWizard offers deep customization to tailor predictions to your specific needs:

Interactive Location Selection: Users can easily select any location on Earth by clicking on the map, supported by clear zoom and pan functionality.

Custom Likelihood Prediction: The application instantly calculates the probability of five key conditions for the specified date: “Very Hot,” “Very Cold,” “Very Windy,” “Very Wet,” and “Very Uncomfortable.”

Personalized Discomfort Threshold: Users can set a specific temperature threshold (in °C) to define what feels "uncomfortable" to them, directly influencing the final "Very Uncomfortable" score.

Combined Likelihood Scoring: The "Very Uncomfortable" likelihood is a joint score, calculating the maximum probability based on two factors: the user's selected discomfort category (e.g., "Very Wet") and the general temperature/humidity-based discomfort threshold.

Gemini AI Insights: After prediction, users can access the “Weather Insights ✨” feature, which uses the Gemini API to analyze the likelihood scores and generate a plain-language summary with practical travel and activity advice.

NASA Mission Context: Provides external links to relevant NASA Earth Science Missions (Giovanni, GES DISC, Hydrology Rods) to provide context on the scientific tools used to gather climate and observation data.
Technology Stack
WeatherWizard is built as a single-page, real-time application using modern web technologies:

Frontend: HTML5, pure JavaScript (ES6+), and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, colorful, and gradient-heavy UI.

Mapping: Leaflet.js for interactive, clickable mapping functionality.

Data Source: Integration with NASA data & APIs for reliable, future weather predictions.

Intelligence Layer: Google Gemini API for generating custom, context-aware user insights and travel advice.

Aesthetics: Vibrant blue, purple, and green gradients are used throughout the UI to create an engaging and modern user experience.

<h2>Core Features and Personalization</h2>
WeatherWizard offers deep customization to tailor predictions to your specific needs:

Interactive Location Selection: Users can easily select any location on Earth by clicking on the map, supported by clear zoom and pan functionality.

Custom Likelihood Prediction: The application instantly calculates the probability of five key conditions for the specified date: “Very Hot,” “Very Cold,” “Very Windy,” “Very Wet,” and “Very Uncomfortable.”

Personalized Discomfort Threshold: Users can set a specific temperature threshold (in °C) to define what feels "uncomfortable" to them, directly influencing the final "Very Uncomfortable" score.

Combined Likelihood Scoring: The "Very Uncomfortable" likelihood is a joint score, calculating the maximum probability based on two factors: the user's selected discomfort category (e.g., "Very Wet") and the general temperature/humidity-based discomfort threshold.

Gemini AI Insights: After prediction, users can access the “Weather Insights ✨” feature, which uses the Gemini API to analyze the likelihood scores and generate a plain-language summary with practical travel and activity advice.

NASA Mission Context: Provides external links to relevant NASA Earth Science Missions (Giovanni, GES DISC) to provide context on the scientific tools used to gather climate and observation data.
